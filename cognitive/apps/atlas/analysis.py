# PAGERANK ###############################################################

# Gets all nodes connected by some relationship and updates each node with the property key pagerank.
# The value of the pagerank property is a float data type, ex. pagerank: 3.14159265359.
# PageRank is used to find the relative importance of a node within a set
# of connected nodes.

# CLOSENESS_CENTRALITY ###################################################

# Gets all nodes connected by some relationship and updates each node with the property key closeness_centrality.
# The value of the closeness_centrality property is a float data type, ex. pagerank: 0.1337.
# A key node centrality measure in networks is closeness centrality
# (Freeman, 1978; Opsahl et al., 2010; Wasserman and Faust, 1994). It is
# defined as the inverse of farness, which in turn, is the sum of
# distances to all other nodes.

# BETWEENNESS_CENTRALITY #################################################

# Gets all nodes connected by some relationship and updates each node with the property key betweenness_centrality.
# The value of the betweenness_centrality property is a float data type, ex. betweenness_centrality: 20.345.
# Betweenness centrality is an indicator of a node's centrality in a
# network. It is equal to the number of shortest paths from all vertices
# to all others that pass through that node. A node with high betweenness
# centrality has a large influence on the transfer of items through the
# network, under the assumption that item transfer follows the shortest
# paths.

# TRIANGLE_COUNTING ######################################################

# :GET /service/mazerunner/analysis/triangle_count/MEASUREDBY

# Gets all nodes connected by some relationship and updates each node with the property key triangle_count.
# The value of the triangle_count property is an integer data type, ex. triangle_count: 2.
# The value of triangle_count represents the count of the triangles that a node is connected to.
# A node is part of a triangle when it has two adjacent nodes with a
# relationship between them. The triangle_count property provides a
# measure of clustering for each node.

# CONNECTED_COMPONENTS ###################################################

# :GET /service/mazerunner/analysis/connected_components/MEASUREDBY

# Gets all nodes connected by some relationship and updates each node with the property key connected_components.
# The value of connected_components property is an integer data type, ex. connected_components: 181.
# The value of connected_components represents the Neo4j internal node ID that has the lowest integer value for a set of connected nodes.
# Connected components are used to find isolated clusters, that is, a
# group of nodes that can reach every other node in the group through a
# bidirectional traversal.

# STRONGLY_CONNECTED_COMPONENTS ##########################################

# :GET /service/mazerunner/analysis/strongly_connected_components/MEASUREDBY

# Gets all nodes connected by some relationship and updates each node with the property key strongly_connected_components.
# The value of strongly_connected_components property is an integer data type, ex. strongly_connected_components: 26.
# The value of strongly_connected_components represents the Neo4j internal node ID that has the lowest integer value for a set of strongly connected nodes.
# Strongly connected components are used to find clusters, that is, a
# group of nodes that can reach every other node in the group through a
# directed traversal.

# 2) How often should analyses be run, and how? (eg, daily celery job vs. on request)
# 3) How do we know when the analysis has finished (and results are available?)

# and how do we implement different similarity metrics for nodes? (eg, wang)
